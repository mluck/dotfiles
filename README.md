This is a repository to store information regarding my personal computer environment including applications and configurations/preferences.

My computer is Mac OS on which I have the following setup. You'll notice that I don't have Python installed on my computer. Although I used to be an Emacs user, I now do my development [in Visual Studio Code inside Docker containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).

- GitHub 
- Docker
- Visual Studio Code
  - Extensions
    - Python (ms-python.python)
    - GitHub (github.vscode-pull-request-github)
    - Docker (ms-azuretools.vscode-docker)
  - Tools

    - Pytest
