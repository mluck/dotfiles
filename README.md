This is a repository to store information regarding my personal computer environment including applications and configurations/preferences.

My computer is Mac OS on which I have the following setup. You'll notice that I don't have Python installed on my computer. Although I used to be an Emacs user, I now do my development [in Visual Studio Code inside Docker containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).

- Homebrew: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

- iTerm2: `brew install --cask iterm2`

- Terminal (shell) customization
    - oh-my-zsh: `brew install zsh`
    - powerlevel10k
